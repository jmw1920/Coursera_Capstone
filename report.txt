Introduction
The problem I aim to solve is determining which suburb in Northeast Ohio will be the most promising to open a new coffee shop.  This is a business problem that many aspiring entrepreneurs face, and I think entrepreneurs located in the Northeast Ohio area will be interested to see the results.
Data
I will be collecting data from Foursquare to determine which suburbs from Northeast Ohio have the most coffee shops, as well as the highest rated coffee shops.  I will cluster the suburbs based on this information using K-means.  An entrepreneur interested in opening a coffee shop in the area may then analyze the clusters and determine which cluster they would be interested in opening a shop in- towns with many, high-rated coffee shops, towns with few, low-rated coffee shops, etc.  I think the best business opportunity would be in the suburbs that are determined to have a low number of coffee shops without a particularly high rating, so they do not have much competition nearby.
